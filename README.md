# SpeakerSelect

SpeakerSelect is my replacement for the macOS Sound menu extra.

### Features

- Reorder/rename/hide audio devices.
- Change the icon of audio devices.
- Applies presets for my [audio optimizer kernel extension](https://github.com/iccir/AudioOptimizerPlugin).

### Non-features

- Input devices.
- Transparency effects (I run with Reduce Transparency enabled).
- UI for settings (it's a JSON file)
